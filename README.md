# Grape

## An open-source Anime and Manga tracker, built with Vue and Ruby on Rails.

Grape is the product of a bored high school student with an enthusiasm for open-source projects, and the frustration that most of the good Anime and Manga trackers weren't open-source. It is also the product of two crates of ramen and hot cocoa.
